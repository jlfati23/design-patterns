The `LazyRegistryIODH` class uses the **Initialization-on-Demand Holder (IODH)** idiom to implement the singleton pattern. This idiom ensures that the singleton instance is created in a thread-safe manner without the need for explicit synchronization. Let's break down the code and explain how it works:

### Class Definition

```java
public class LazyRegistryIODH {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    private LazyRegistryIODH() {
        System.out.println("This constructor is called");
    }

    // Static nested class to hold the singleton instance
    private static class LazyRegistryIODHHolder {
        // Singleton instance is created when this class is loaded
        private static final LazyRegistryIODH INSTANCE = new LazyRegistryIODH();
    }

    // Public method to provide access to the singleton instance
    public static LazyRegistryIODH getInstance() {
        return LazyRegistryIODHHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Private Constructor**:
    ```java
    private LazyRegistryIODH() {
        System.out.println("This constructor is called");
    }
    ```
   The constructor is private, preventing any external class from instantiating a new object of `LazyRegistryIODH`. This is essential for the singleton pattern.

2. **Static Nested Class**:
    ```java
    private static class LazyRegistryIODHHolder {
        private static final LazyRegistryIODH INSTANCE = new LazyRegistryIODH();
    }
    ```
   This static nested class holds the singleton instance. The instance is initialized when the `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class is loaded.

3. **Public Method to Get Instance**:
    ```java
    public static LazyRegistryIODH getInstance() {
        return LazyRegistryIODHHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
    ```
   The `getInstance` method returns the singleton instance held by `LazyRegistryIODHHolder`.

### Key Points

1. **Lazy Initialization**:
   The `LazyRegistryIODH` instance is created only when the `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class is loaded. This ensures lazy initialization without the need for explicit synchronization.

2. **Class Loading**:
   The nested `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class is not loaded until the `getInstance` method is called. When the `getInstance` method is called for the first time, the `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class is loaded, and the `INSTANCE` is created.

3. **Thread-Safe**:
   Class loading in Java is thread-safe. The Java Language Specification guarantees that a class will be loaded and initialized in a thread-safe manner. Therefore, when the `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class is loaded, the `INSTANCE` is created in a thread-safe way.

4. **No Synchronization Overhead**:
   Unlike double-checked locking, this approach does not require synchronization, thus avoiding the associated overhead.

### Summary

To answer your question directly:

**No, the `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class (and thus the `INSTANCE`) will not be initialized when the `LazyRegistryIODH` class is created.** The `LazyRegistryIODHHolder` class and the `INSTANCE` are only loaded and initialized when the `getInstance` method is called for the first time. This ensures that the singleton instance is created only when needed, achieving lazy initialization in a thread-safe manner without explicit synchronization.
The static nested class LazyRegistryIODHHolder and its static variable INSTANCE are initialized only when LazyRegistryIODHHolder is first accessed, which happens when LazyRegistryIODH.getInstance() is called for the first time. This lazy initialization ensures that the singleton instance is created only when needed and in a thread-safe manner without requiring explicit synchronization.
